This is my first Adapt course. To start the program, clone the repository and cd into it. Make sure NodeJs is intalled and run:
	npm install
	adapt install
	npm install grunt

Once Adapt and Grunt are installed, then run:

	grunt build
	
	grunt server-scorm
	

A browser window should open automatically with my adapt course.
